# MRI Speech Denoising Toolbox
Matlab toolbox for removing MRI pulse sequence noises from speech recorded in an MRI scanner.

Dependencies: Requires [NMF Toolbox](https://github.com/colinvaz/nmf-toolbox).

Tested on Matlab R2014a and R2016a on Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8.

`denoise_example.m` is a short script showing how to denoise speech contaminated with MRI noise. Full documentation of the various configuration parameters can be found in `MRIdenoising.m` and also viewed by typing `help MRIdenoising` at the Matlab command prompt.
